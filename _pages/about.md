I am **Ali Farhani**, a Product Management and Blockchain specialist with a background in **Industrial Engineering** and a strong focus on **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**, tokenization, and blockchain-based systems.

I currently work as a **Product Owner at IraniCard**, where I have played a key role in the development and growth of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related products, particularly in the OTC exchange landscape. My professional experience bridges technical blockchain concepts with practical product design, delivery, and governance.

In parallel with my industry work, I am an active contributor to the blockchain ecosystem. I am a **Persian Translator at the Ethereum Foundation**, contributing to the localization of ethereum.org and collaborating with a global open-source community. I am also a member of the **Iran Blockchain Community**, a non-governmental organization focused on education, advocacy, and ecosystem development in Iran.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **DeFi institutionalization**, **digital asset tokenization**, **Decentralized Science (DeSci)**, and **blockchain-enabled transparency systems**. I have authored and co-authored academic and preprint publications on topics such as regulatory trends in DeFi and the use of **Digital Product Passports (DPPs)** and blockchain technologies for sustainable lithium battery and electric vehicle supply chains.

This website serves as a centralized hub for my **publications, research activities, professional experience, and selected projects**. It also provides access to my academic profiles, including Google Scholar, SSRN, and other professional platforms.
